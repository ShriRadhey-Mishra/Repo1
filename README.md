In this lab we performed and understood the working and the use of git submodules.

Using the command `git submodule add <git_link>` we can create a reference directory of the repository on the remote location. Using this reference directory we can access the content for our local repository.

In this lab particularly, we created 3 different repositories namely, Repo1, Repo2, and Repo3. In Repo1, we had a MAIN file which only had an HTML file. In Repo2 we have a CSS file and in Repo3 we have a JS file. In Repo1, we now use the submodule command to add Repo2 and Repo3 as the submodules, and access their content for our MAIN HTML file.

## DevOps Lab 4 – Hosting using GitHub Pages  
[https://github.com/ShriRadhey-Mishra/ShriRadhey-Mishra.github.io.git]

When we have created a repository, we can host either its HTML content or the README markdown page on GitHub Pages, just by following these simple steps:

1. Write a markdown or an HTML which you want to be hosted.  
2. Push it to the repository whose content you want to host.  
3. Go to the settings in that repository and then select GitHub Pages.  
4. Select “Deploy from Branch” in the source section (selected by default).  
5. Then in the branch section, select the branch and save.  
6. Now in the custom domain, link your GitHub repository’s location and save.  

You’ll see a “Your site is live at: <source_location>”, where you’ll either see the HTML or the markdown file’s content.

Using GitHub Pages, we can simply host any repository we want.
