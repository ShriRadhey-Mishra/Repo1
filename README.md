This is Repo1, which contains a directory called "MAIN" which contains a simple HTML.
We then added Repo2 and Repo3 using git submodule command.
Syntax: git submodule add <repository_link> 

This created a referenced repository which we call submodule which allows to access the contents of Repo2 and Repo3 without cloning them.

We will then host it to github pages where it will show the use of all the three repositories.
