This is Repo1, which contains a directory called "MAIN" which contains a simple HTML.
We then added Repo2 and Repo3 using git submodule command.
Syntax: git submodule add <repository_link> 

This created a referenced repository which we call submodule which allows to access the contents of Repo2 and Repo3 without cloning them.
